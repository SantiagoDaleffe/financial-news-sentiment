         "",
         "Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao reacted to an altcoin project on social media platform X. The official X account of Slerf (SLERF), a memecoin project within the Solana ecosystem, shared a screenshot of a message allegedly exchanged between the developers and Zhao. The conversation in question included statements indicating Zhao's interest in SLERF. There was a sudden increase in the price of SLERF within minutes of the post, with the token seeing a sudden appreciation of approximately 4%. Chart showing the rise in the price of SLERF. Following CZ's announcement, the token's price also saw a decline. Related News: What Did Giant Altcoin Whales Do During Bitcoin's Rise? Here Are Their Transactions However, Zhao's real X account quickly responded to the project's post. Zhao categorically stated that he had no connection to the project and that the screenshot was fake: “It's fake. If you believe a screenshot is real in 2025, your assets will soon become someone else's assets.” Slerf developers, on the other hand, argued that the screenshot was shared “for joke purposes” and that they did not want to cause an increase in the price of their token with the fake image. *This is not investment advice.

         "",
         "The Cardano reserves on Coinbase have surged 462% since the exchange launched wrapped ADA on base. This follows earlier reports that the XRP supply on the crypto exchange has fallen drastically, indicating significant investor demand. Cardano Reserves on Coinbase Rise 462% Since Launch Coinbase’s proof of reserves shows that there is a total supply of 9.56 million ADA for its reserve, which is used to back the wrapped ADA on the Base network. There is currently a total supply of 9.53 million cbADA on the Base network . This represents a 462% increase from when the crypto exchange launched the wrapped token with a supply of 1.7 million in June. This highlights the significant demand for Cardano as investors use the wrapped token for DeFi activities on the Ethereum network. A community member, Mintern, with ties to the Cardano DEX Minswap, also noted how the ADA reserves on Coinbase have more than doubled in just the last month, indicating a sustained momentum. Mintern also questioned if this meant that institutional confidence was about to explode. Notably, this comes ahead of the potential launch of the Grayscale Cardano ETF , which is expected to increase the demand for ADA as institutional investors look to gain exposure. The launch of this fund could happen this month, considering that the final deadline under the 19b-4 standard was this month. Meanwhile, Hashdex has also included Cardano in its crypto index fund , a move that could also spark increased demand for ADA. The Cardano reserves on Coinbase could further increase in the coming months, considering that the exchange’s custody arm is the custodian for Grayscale’s ADA fund. Its reserve will include ADA tokens held on behalf of the Trust. XRP Supply On Coinbase Drops The increase in Cardano reserves on Coinbase coincides with a drop in the XRP supply on Coinbase. Crypto expert Del had revealed that over the last 90 days, the supply of XRP on Coinbase fell from 970 million to 99 million. Based on this, he declared that market participants are not ready for what comes next. This also comes just ahead of the launch of the XRP ETFs , which could boost the altcoin’s demand. The current demand for ADA and XRP highlights the possible rotation from BTC and ETH to altcoins that are set to have their own spot crypto ETF. Bitcoinist reported how institutions dumped BTC and ETH last week while XRP and SOL witnessed significant inflows from these investors. The launch of these ETFs is expected to serve as a catalyst for higher prices for these altcoins. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.85, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",

         "",
         "The UK will lift its retail ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) starting next week, allowing ETNs listed on an FCA-approved UK investment exchange to trade to retail investors, while crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain restricted under the current UK funds framework. Retail access restored to crypto ETNs from next week when listed on an FCA-approved UK exchange. ETNs are debt securities linked to crypto prices, not asset-backed ETFs; ETFs for retail remain blocked under current UK fund rules. Companies like BlackRock and Bitwise are preparing UK offerings; FCA prospectus reviews begin Sept. 23, potentially delaying trading start dates. UK crypto ETNs ban lift: Retail trading starts next week for FCA-approved listings — read details and next steps for investors. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"UK to Lift Retail Ban on Crypto ETNs Next Week; ETFs Still Restricted\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"The Financial Conduct Authority will lift its 2019 retail ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for products listed on an FCA-approved UK exchange, while retail access to crypto ETFs remains blocked under current fund regulations.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/uk-crypto-etns-ban-lift\" }} What is the UK crypto ETNs ban lift? UK crypto ETNs ban lift means the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will allow retail investors to trade crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) listed on an FCA-approved, UK-based investment exchange starting next week. ETNs are debt instruments tied to crypto prices and differ from ETFs because they do not hold underlying assets. How will the FCA implement the change? The FCA requires ETNs to be listed on a Recognised Investment Exchange and will begin accepting prospectuses on Sept. 23. Regulators will review filings and may issue comments before listings go live, which could delay some product launches by days or a week. When can retail investors trade crypto ETNs in the UK? The ban lift is effective next week, contingent on ETNs being listed on an FCA-approved UK exchange and passing prospectus review. Some asset managers aim to begin retail trading on or after Oct. 8, but final trading dates depend on regulator feedback and listing timelines. Why are ETFs still restricted for UK retail investors? Under the current UK regulatory framework for funds, ETFs marketed to retail investors cannot invest directly into cryptoassets. The FCA said the framework would need updating before crypto ETFs could be offered to UK retail customers. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How retail investors can prepare to trade crypto ETNs in the UK\", \"description\": \"Steps for UK retail investors to prepare for the lifting of the ETN ban.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 1, \"name\": \"Confirm product listing\", \"text\": \"Check that the ETN is listed on an FCA-approved, UK-based investment exchange once prospectuses are accepted.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 2, \"name\": \"Review prospectus and risks\", \"text\": \"Read the ETN prospectus carefully to understand credit risk, issuer structure, and fee schedules.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 3, \"name\": \"Compare providers\", \"text\": \"Compare offerings from asset managers preparing UK products and review issuer reputations and disclosures.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 4, \"name\": \"Consider tax and custody implications\", \"text\": \"Assess tax treatment and whether you need separate custody arrangements; consult a tax adviser if needed.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will the UK allow retail crypto ETFs after the ETN change? Not immediately. The FCA stated its current funds framework prevents retail ETFs from investing directly in cryptoassets; legislative or regulatory updates would be required before retail crypto ETFs are permitted. Are ETNs backed by crypto assets? No. ETNs are unsecured debt securities whose value tracks a reference index or price (for example, Bitcoin). They are not asset-backed investment funds and carry issuer credit risk. Which companies are preparing UK offerings? Asset managers with UK or European operations—reported examples include BlackRock, Bitwise, and CoinShares—have publicly stated preparations to offer exchange-traded products once listings and FCA approvals progress. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"When does the retail ban lift for crypto ETNs in the UK?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"The FCA will allow retail trading of crypto ETNs listed on an approved UK exchange starting next week, subject to successful prospectus filings and exchange listings.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How are ETNs different from ETFs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"ETNs are debt instruments that track crypto prices and carry issuer credit risk; ETFs are funds that typically hold underlying assets and are governed by fund regulations.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Do retail investors need to do anything before trading ETNs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Investors should confirm listings on an FCA-approved exchange, review prospectuses, compare product terms, and consider tax and custody implications.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways Immediate change : The UK will lift the retail ban on crypto ETNs for products listed on an FCA-approved UK exchange. ETNs vs ETFs : ETNs are unsecured debt tied to crypto price indices; ETFs remain restricted for retail under current fund rules. Investor action : Check exchange listings, read prospectuses, and monitor FCA feedback before trading. Conclusion The UK crypto ETNs ban lift opens retail access to exchange-traded notes listed on FCA-approved UK investment exchanges, while crypto ETFs remain restricted until the funds framework changes. Investors should review prospectuses and issuer disclosures and follow FCA updates as listings and trading dates are confirmed. Published: 2025-08-01 | Updated: 2025-10-01 | Author: COINOTAG",

         "",
         "Bitcoin surged to $120,132 on Thursday, marking its highest level in seven weeks as October’s “Uptober” rally gathered steam. The cryptocurrency gained 4% in 24 hours, breaking through resistance at $117,500 and pressing against the symbolic $120,000 mark. At this level, Bitcoin’s market capitalization rose to $2.37 trillion, surpassing Amazon’s value, while the broader crypto market swelled to $4.16 trillion. The rally spilled into altcoins, with Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin climbing 5–6% in sympathy. Analysts point to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts as a key driver. Softer U.S. labor data has fueled speculation that policymakers may ease monetary conditions later this month, boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Crypto Jump With U.S. fiscal uncertainty brewing, capital historically seeks refuge in crypto, and the chart shows it. Over the last 7 days: • $SOL +6.7% • $ETH +6.5% • $BTC +4.1% • $XRP +3.4% Spaghetti chart confirms majors pulling ahead while macro tension builds.… pic.twitter.com/Gv5CfQuMnP — BB Terminal (@BB_Terminal) October 1, 2025 October has historically been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, and traders are betting the trend could continue. Breaking decisively above $120,000 would open the door for another leg higher, potentially toward all-time highs if momentum holds. CME Plans 24/7 Futures by 2026 Adding to the optimism, the CME Group announced plans to launch 24/7 trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options by early 2026, pending regulatory approval. Currently, CME halts crypto futures trading over weekends, a mismatch with global markets that operate 24/7. The shift is designed to meet growing institutional demand for continuous risk management. Tim McCourt, CME’s global head of equities and alternative products, said the move should enhance market efficiency, reduce arbitrage gaps, and strengthen liquidity. CME Group is taking crypto futures and options 24/7 starting early 2026 The exchange says demand from clients to manage risk “every day of the week” keeps growing, and crypto is the perfect testing ground for round-the-clock markets. pic.twitter.com/blAzbQbewM — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) October 2, 2025 Analysts believe this will cement Bitcoin’s role in mainstream finance, encouraging more hedge funds and asset managers to participate. Institutional adoption has long been a catalyst for Bitcoin price growth. By aligning with the 24/7 nature of digital assets, CME could accelerate that trend and provide fresh liquidity for both spot and derivatives markets. Sweden Weighs Bitcoin Reserve, Bearish Pattern Emerges Meanwhile, Sweden is considering joining the ranks of nations exploring Bitcoin reserves. Lawmakers Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez have proposed a national reserve built from seized Bitcoin, arguing it would protect the country from inflation and geopolitical risks. The idea aligns with broader international discussions, with the U.S. also examining Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. A national Bitcoin reserve in Sweden could set a precedent across Europe, reinforcing the asset’s credibility and potentially sparking new institutional inflows. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview From a technical perspective , however, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin’s current rally is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern, with the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) projected between $128,000 and $130,000. While momentum remains bullish in the short term, this harmonic structure warns of potential selling pressure at higher levels. Support levels : $117,000, $113,500, $106,900 Resistance targets : $124,600, $128,000–$130,000 (PRZ) A clean breakout above $124,600 could pave the way toward the PRZ, but overbought RSI conditions suggest the risk of a pullback increases the closer Bitcoin gets to $130,000. A failure to hold $117,000 could expose deeper supports at $113,500 and $106,900. Bitcoin is forming a Bearish Butterfly pattern. Resistance: $124.6K, PRZ $128K–$130K Support: $117K / $113.5K / $106.9K Momentum looks bullish short term, but caution: risk of reversal grows as price nears the PRZ. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C4r5rWUm5B — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 3, 2025 For traders, the outlook is clear: Uptober momentum is strong, institutional demand is rising, and global policy shifts are supportive. But the technical picture advises caution at higher levels, as the rally nears a zone where profit-taking could emerge.

         "",
         "Etsy crypto spells are handcrafted listings where sellers claim rituals, oracle cards, or custom manifestations will influence a buyer’s cryptocurrency fortune. These offerings typically range from basic $20 spells to advanced $73 “millionaire” rituals and include disclaimers that outcomes are for entertainment and not guaranteed. Sellers market rituals, oracle cards, and bespoke crypto spells on Etsy. Pricing often ranges from about $20 to $73 for premium “millionaire” spells. Many listings include entertainment-only disclaimers and vary widely in sales and reviews. Etsy crypto spells: understand claims, pricing, and safety—read COINOTAG’s concise guide now. What are Etsy crypto spells and how do sellers describe them? Etsy crypto spells are product listings where sellers advertise rituals, personalized manifestations, or oracle-card readings intended to influence financial luck in cryptocurrency markets. Listings commonly describe spiritual alignment, candle rituals, and customized intentions tied to a buyer’s crypto holdings while including disclaimers that results cannot be guaranteed. How common are these listings and who’s buying them? These offerings have proliferated on Etsy and social platforms this year. Some shops show modest sales, while long-standing sellers report thousands of transactions. One account advertising similar services reports more than 120,000 sales at roughly $18 per item, illustrating demand for metaphysical goods linked to finance and lifestyle. New trend: sellers on Etsy list spells, oracle cards and rituals that claim to boost cryptocurrency fortunes, promising alignment with market “prosperity” or bespoke crypto-focused manifestations. Listings vary in scope and price. A typical structure includes a basic ritual for about $20, an upgraded performance at $42, and a high-tier package dubbed a “millionaire spell” for roughly $73. Descriptions emphasize spiritual intent and personal energy alignment with market success, but many include explicit disclaimers framing the service as entertainment. Promotional image from the crypto spell listing. Source: Etsy Beyond spells, sellers advertise novel formats like “Bitcoin Oracle Cards” and coin-specific rituals—examples include a “Dogecoin wealth ritual” that pairs candles, crystals, and downloadable affirmations. Sellers often provide short videos or images to illustrate ritual components and the intended client experience. Social channels and forums note buyer reactions ranging from curiosity to satire. A Reddit post recounted a user paying for a ritual aimed at driving Bitcoin to a specific price target. Public reaction has been mixed, with some users mocking claims and others treating listings as playful or therapeutic alternatives to conventional financial advice. Bitcoin Oracle cards. Source: Etsy Why do these listings matter to buyers and regulators? They highlight the intersection of commerce, belief, and speculative finance. For consumers, the core issues are transparency, consumer protection, and financial literacy. For platforms, the question is enforcement of content rules that prohibit certain metaphysical services but still allow a wide range of spiritual goods. Buyers should note that many sellers include entertainment disclaimers and avoid specific time-bound promises. Reported metrics—sales volume and review averages—offer signals about a shop’s longevity but are not proof of efficacy for financial outcomes. Etsy Bitcoin price spell post on r/Bitcoin. Source: Reddit What should potential buyers consider before purchasing? Read listings thoroughly, check seller history and reviews, and treat claims about guaranteed market outcomes skeptically. Verify refund policies and be wary of any service that equates ritual work with financial returns. Approach such purchases as consumer-grade entertainment rather than investment advice. Summary table: Typical listing tiers and claims Package Typical Price Common Claims Basic Spell $20 General prosperity, spiritual alignment Advanced Spell $42 Targeted intentions, enhanced ritual elements “Millionaire” Spell $73 High-impact manifestation, bespoke focus on crypto { \"@context\":\"https://schema.org\", \"@type\":\"HowTo\", \"name\":\"How to evaluate an Etsy crypto spell listing\", \"description\":\"A step-by-step guide to assessing crypto-related ritual listings on Etsy for transparency and consumer safety.\", \"image\":[\"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a7b2-5619-7b73-a23d-205fbe0576ca.webp\"], \"step\":[ {\"@type\":\"HowToStep\",\"name\":\"Read the listing\",\"text\":\"Check the description for specific claims, timeframes, and disclaimers.\"}, {\"@type\":\"HowToStep\",\"name\":\"Check seller history\",\"text\":\"Review number of sales, ratings, and longevity of the shop.\"}, {\"@type\":\"HowToStep\",\"name\":\"Understand pricing vs. promise\",\"text\":\"Compare price tiers to stated outcomes and watch for guaranteed returns.\"}, {\"@type\":\"HowToStep\",\"name\":\"Treat as entertainment\",\"text\":\"Recognize spiritual services are not financial advice and may include disclaimers.\"} ]} { \"@context\":\"https://schema.org\", \"@type\":\"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\":[ { \"@type\":\"Question\", \"name\":\"Do Etsy crypto spells guarantee financial returns?\", \"acceptedAnswer\":{ \"@type\":\"Answer\", \"text\":\"No. Most listings include disclaimers that services are for entertainment or spiritual guidance and do not guarantee financial results.\" } }, { \"@type\":\"Question\", \"name\":\"How much do crypto spell listings typically cost on Etsy?\", \"acceptedAnswer\":{ \"@type\":\"Answer\", \"text\":\"Common price points observed include about $20 for basic rituals, $42 for advanced services, and around $73 for high-tier or “millionaire” packages.\" } }, { \"@type\":\"Question\", \"name\":\"What should buyers check before purchasing a crypto spell?\", \"acceptedAnswer\":{ \"@type\":\"Answer\", \"text\":\"Buyers should read the full listing, check seller ratings and sales history, confirm refund policies, and treat claims of guaranteed market effects with skepticism.\" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Are crypto spells on Etsy legal to sell? Yes, selling spiritual or metaphysical goods is generally legal, but platforms may set policies restricting certain services. Listings that avoid explicit fraudulent promises typically remain available as consumer products. Can a ritual influence cryptocurrency markets? There is no empirical evidence that ritual work can change market prices. Market movements depend on economic, technological, and regulatory factors reported by established financial sources. Key Takeaways Claim vs. evidence : Ritual listings often claim financial benefits but lack verifiable proof. Consumer caution : Check reviews, seller history, and disclaimers before buying. Entertainment framing : Treat crypto spells as metaphysical or entertainment purchases, not investment advice. Conclusion Listings advertising Etsy crypto spells blend spiritual services with financial language to attract buyers. While some shops show high sales volume, claims of guaranteed crypto gains are unsupported and usually labeled as entertainment. Consumers should prioritize transparency and view these products as non-financial services.
